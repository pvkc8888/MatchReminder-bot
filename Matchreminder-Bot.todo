MatchReminder-Bot:
✔ A reddit bot that tracks a submission from D2TournamentThreads and private messages the subscribers when a new post is up indicating that a match is about to start! @created(21-03-18 10:50)

 Feels pretty good when you know you made something cool for the online community and people are actually using it.

Enhancements:
  ☐ PMing the bot should be able to add them to the list. @created(21-03-18 11:24)
  I think this is easy to check pms and check for the body of the message and compare it with the trigger word and add the users to the list.

  ☐ yeah stdout wont do much good, we have to add print comments to log file @created(21-03-18 11:26)
  when we just print the comment out, we cant access it later, but if we write it out to a log file, we can check it whenever we want.

  ☐ Option to Unsubscribe @created(21-03-18 11:27)
  right now we dont have the option for the user to unsubscribe, so maybe we can ask them to send a pm to the bot and unsubscribe them.


 Future Work:
   ☐ Other gaming subreddits?
   have to check out the feasability option of implementing it on other gaming/other? subreddits.

   ☐ Database for better file handling?
   If we catch more wind, maybe we can try changing the database from text files to an actual database for better functionality.
